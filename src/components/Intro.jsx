            I'm a highly motivated recent graduate from Northeastern University with a 
            Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I have two electrical engineering co-op experiences
            and multiple technical projects showcasing my software and web development skills.
            <br />
            I have a strong passion for computer hardware, embedded systems, and software and am seeking roles in those fields.
            This website highlights a few of the projects I have completed.
